### Perl scripts for HexChat and/or Xchat

#### ctrl-enter.pl
Sends the text in the inputbox to the server without any processing. Mostly useful for sending lines starting with a slash, instead of prefixing it with another slash or using /say.

#### undo-redo.pl
Adds undo and redo functionality to the inputbox. Hit Ctrl-Z for undo and Ctrl-Y/Ctrl-Shift-Z for redo. Based on [TingPing's script](https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/undo.py) with a few improvments.
